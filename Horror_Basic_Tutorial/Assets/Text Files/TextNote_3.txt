Ever since that day, everyone in the classroom looked at me strangely. I started to feel so confused so I couldn't remember the time or date.
Even though studying acting is difficult and I try to practice so hard because it's that I like, and even though my face is bad, it doesn't matter, right?
And everyone in the class started bullying me and making fun of me that I was weird and every day the bullying got harder and harder, more than I can imagined.
And it make me don't want to study in this school again.
