January, 8th
This has been one week since the first day of school. The time passed so quickly probably because I enjoyed it so much.
Today's class was still as fun as ever.
Today I also learned about acting. I'm really excited because I actually went to this school because I wanted to study acting.
Today's class is over and this acting class was really difficult and I having so much fun.
But why are my friends looking at me and acting strangely today?

WHY WHY WHY ?
