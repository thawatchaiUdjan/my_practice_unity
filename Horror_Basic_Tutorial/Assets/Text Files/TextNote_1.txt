January, 1st
Today is a very good day. It was also my first day of school. I can't wait to enjoy about this.
Today's first lesson is a lesson about singing. I really enjoyed taking this class.
In addition, the teachers are kind and teach well and my friends in the room are friendly to me.
Today my first day of school has ended.
I really enjoyed it and really don't want this kind of study to end...
