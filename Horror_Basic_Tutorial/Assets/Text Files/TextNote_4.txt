Even studying this semester has ended.
Even this school no longer exists.
Even no one girl on classroom remember me.
Even I'm dead. 
I still write down on my diary.
Every day, even I was bullied, there was always someone who take care me and told the teachers about it. But we weren't close because I couldn't say anything else except "sorry." It seemed to make him misleading.
But there's one thing I've wanted to do long before I die. One thing I've wanted to say for a long time. There's only one word I want to say to him. But it must be too late...

(I hope I can say it)
